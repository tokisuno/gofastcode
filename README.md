# GO fast
There's an hour video on YouTube on how to learn go fast. This was just me copying down the code from there and running it. There's nothing special about this repo. It's just there to show that I did something with GO and to use later as a reference.

I also skipped the final API lesson since I am not really interested in building APIs atm. I mainly just want to automate shit in my system and build CLI applications. Nothing more, nothing less.
